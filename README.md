Software Development I: Module 1 Assignment

The code I uploaded is an assignment I did in a previous class, Java Programming. We were learning GUIs and had to create a functioning calculator. 
I uploaded this assignment here, which is also an assignment, to get a better understanding of how gitHub works and to familiarize myself with 
the process and conceopt of Version Control for efficient and professional programming.
